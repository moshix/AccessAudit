What is AccessAudit?
====================

AccessAudit is an extension to Linux instances to log all logins securely and tamperproof in in the immudb Vault immutable database for audit and forensic purposes. All logins are logged with rich metadata  (IP, time, user, time etc.). A query tool is provided to query and serach the audit log in the database and export it. 

AccessAudit allows server administrator, auditors etc. to provide a cryptographically strong, and tamperproof tally all accesses to their Linux instances.

4. Gives you a query tool to search immudb Vault for logins and related info and export values in CSV
